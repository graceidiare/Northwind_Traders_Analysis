## Introduction      
_The Northwind Traders database is originally a fictional sample database used by Microsoft. However, I downloaded this modified version from [Maven Analytics](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/) data playground. It models a fictitious gourmet food supplier which sells various products such as beverages, confections, meat, seafood, etc to customers._
